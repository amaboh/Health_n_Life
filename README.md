# Health_n_Life

### Overview 
This file contains two projects related to health and life. 
"A healthy heart makes the skin glow"

## Motivation 
This was aimed at exploring life from within and without, with a case study of heart disease classification and skin care recommendation engine respectively. The code is implemented in Jupyter Notebook using Scikik-learn library with different models

#### Notebook titled heart_disease 8.ipynb
This notebook implements a decision tree classifier without pruning and pruning. The dataset used for this is derived from thje uci archive dataset (link in the notebook)
This is a series of machine learning algorithms used on health data

#### Notebook titled skin_recom.ipynb
This notebook is structured into two make parts, classification and recommendation task

####### A. Classification task
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic regression
  - SVD with SGD

####### B. Recommendation task using the python Scikit library surprise using 
  - user features,
  - collaborative filtering
  - Content-based filtering

### Dependencies 
  - Python 3.9
  - Scikit learn
  - Surprise
  - nltk

### Setup Instructions 
1. Download the Jupyter Notebook in this repository and upload it to Colab to try it out.
2. Download the Datasets for the Recomemndation system
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the whole notebook or each cell sequentially from top to bottom.
